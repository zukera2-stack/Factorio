# Changelog

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-12 (test branch, Undo stabilization)

- Remove experimental scripted blueprint ghost Undo joining and fixed `undo_index=1`; discard obsolete `blueprint_undo_join` storage marks. Keep native upgrade prototypes, observational event handlers, and the independent special selection-tool queue.
- **Game-tested in Factorio 2.1.20 build 87512:** green Upgrade Planner, robot replacement, Undo and Redo for 26 straight, 4 curved-A and 4 curved-B rails.
- **Game-tested:** chest and rail actions remained independent in Undo/Redo; superforced Ctrl+Shift blueprint overlay on 22 mixed-geometry rails (14 straight, 4 curved-A, 4 curved-B) was undone and redone. A separate 14-straight-rail superforce Undo also succeeded.
- **Still unverified:** half-diagonal geometry, special selection tool, interrupted robot jobs, inventory/refunds, signalling and broader mod compatibility. Acceptance tests A passed, B/C partial, D unverified.
- Evidence: [0.1.8 game-test record](docs/tests/undo-0.1.8-2026-11-12.md). The tested ZIP and its source SHA remain those in [BUILD_018.yaml](docs/BUILD_018.yaml). User approved release PR [#6](https://github.com/zukera2-stack/Factorio/pull/6) to `main` after conflict resolution and CI.

All notable project changes are recorded here.

The project is currently in an early prototype stage. This file starts the public change history; it does not imply that earlier development work did not happen.

## [Unreleased] - Documentation

- Add a reusable prototype-research worksheet and a completed 0.1.7 rail-upgrade research record.
- Make source provenance, target-version API comparison, falsifiable hypotheses, and scoped game evidence explicit requirements before and after non-trivial mechanic work.
- Link the research workflow from contributor instructions, handoff documents, status, architecture, and both README files.
- Correct the README ZIP-folder example to match the current CI archive layout.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-11-12 (diagnostic branch, native ground-rail upgrades)

- Assign a geometry-specific fast-replace group to each matching vanilla/high-speed ground-rail pair; connect the vanilla source to the custom target via `next_upgrade`.
- Stop canceling native `on_marked_for_upgrade` orders; keep the separate scripted rail-replacement selection tool as a fallback.
- **User-verified:** native Upgrade Planner converted 20 vanilla straight rails to high-speed rails with robots. Ctrl+Z returned all 20 to vanilla; Ctrl+Y upgraded them again. Curves, half-diagonal, and Ctrl+Shift superforce workflows still require separate testing.
- Record the [research-first method](docs/RESEARCH_METHOD.md) discovered by comparing Bob's assembler prototypes with a working rail mod and official Factorio API.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-11-12 (experimental branch)

- Test joining delayed replacement ghosts to native Undo using `undo_index=1` for straight rails.
- **User-verified limitation:** superforced-blueprint Undo removed the new rails but did not restore vanilla rails; Redo rebuilt new rails. This is not a complete solution.

## [0.1.0] - Initial repository snapshot

- Added the initial Electrified Mainline mod source.
- Added English and Russian locale files.
- Added the existing `ElectrifiedMainline_0.1.0.zip` archive.
- Added repository documentation and a clear development-status record.
